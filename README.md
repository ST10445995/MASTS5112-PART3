What i changed on the code, Problems i have faced and Installing Dependecies Guide

Good day, welcome to the Urban Bites Restaurant. 

When starting a project, firstly name your project what you want to name on new terminal which is, "npx react-native init UrbanBitesApp --version 0.68.2" . Secondly, install all the dependencies that are needed. The dependencies that have been installed are:
1. npm install @react-native-picker/picker
2. npm install react-native-gesture-handler
3. npm install @react-navigation/stack
4. npm install @react-navigation/native
5.  npm install react-native-screens
6.  npm install react-native-safe-area-context

When all the dependencies have been installed you can now start coding.

What i changed in the code?

Differentiating between part 2 and part 3 i made slight changes. The menu screen now has a calculation where it calculates money of the courses(starters,main and dessert) you chose that was all i have changed. 

Now on part 3, i did as instructed. What i did on my code was to add the "remove and add items" which is on the menu screen. I even opened another file which has all the codes for the remove and add items for the chef to be able to do that.
I created new files, "the filter menu screen, Menu Items Add Sreen".

Challenges i have faced were being able to make the code run. I have tried many ways, made my researches on how to fix a certain error but it was not successful, either i made things worse or still the same no changes.
